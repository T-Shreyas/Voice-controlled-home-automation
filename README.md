# Voice-controlled-home-automation
Voice controlled home automation System (IOT):

##Synopsis and Methodology: -
• The aim of our project is to use this IoT technology for the people of all ages, gender and even with some disability to enjoy the life in a more pleasant way. This project is designed to use the Bluetooth technology to control home utilities i.e. (light and fan). 
• Google voice recognition facility will be utilized to input voice. Android phone will be used for the application software which will be connected to the google voice command input. Application software will be responsible for converting the voice command into the text format. 
• Ultimately application software will transfer that command in the text format to the Arduino Uno using Bluetooth module. This microcontroller (Arduino Uno) is intelligent enough to convert the text command executable according to the programming that is involved as per requirement. 
• So basically, this is a prototype for a voice-controlled home automation system to control appliances with our voice through an Android app. An Arduino Uno board is used for controlling the relay through which one/more appliances are switched on/off. We can modify the Android app to add more functions. The application sends our voice signal command to Bluetooth which is then received by Arduino and perform the described task.


##• Applications and Advantages: -
• It will become the best system for the physically challenged people and for the elderly people to use their mobile phone and control the home utilities easily, implemented in smart homes, etc.
